## SQLVERSE

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate data stored in relational databases. It is an essential tool for data science, as it allows data scientists to efficiently retrieve, manipulate, and transform data stored in databases.

With SQL, data scientists can easily perform a wide range of tasks, such as:
1. Extracting data from a database for analysis
2. Cleaning and preprocessing data before further analysis
3. Generating reports and visualizations based on data in a database
4. Performing statistical analysis on large datasets
5. Creating and managing databases for storing and organizing data

Overall, the ability to effectively use SQL is an important skill for data scientists as it enables them to work with large datasets and extract insights from data stored in databases. Therefore, I created this repo in order to list all my learnings and tips.

### Getting Started
Explore some basics of the SQL, like DML, DDL, Creation of table, etc. before jumping on to it.

### Prerequisites (e.g. software and libraries that need to be installed)
- Any type of SQL tool you prefer
- Very basics of SQL

### Features
I'll be inclusing-
- Basic type of SQL operations & clauses (theory + implementation)
- There will be a comperative study for complex topics like- JOINS
- Comperative cases for JOINS vs UNIONS, etc.
- Covering top & most used SQL caluses in the industry
